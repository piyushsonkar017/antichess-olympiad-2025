            <p><ol><li>The player's account must be created at least 6 months before the time at which they
                register. If you have an account which doesn't satisfy the age requirement but you have
                had an older account, you are requested to play from the older account ,which satisfies
                the age requirement.</li>
                <li>The player must have at least 1000 rated antichess games played on lichess on the

                participate. If this is found after the tournament starts, they are disqualified, and all their
                played matches are forfeited in favour of their opponents.</li>
                <li>If a player is found to have entered the tournament with multiple accounts, both accounts

                <li>There is no increment.</li>
                <li>Both players make a time offer for White. The lowest offer plays White.</li>
                <li>In case of identical offers, the flip of a coin on the House Discord Server will decide who
                gets White.</li>
                <li>The offers must be made privately to a TD who is online at the time the time of the
                armageddon game. If no TD is online, the players may mutually agree to have a third
                party mediate the offers.</li></ol></p>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Match Negotiations</h2>
            <p><ol><li>Each player is required to offer at least 3 separate times at which they can play to their
                opponents within 72 hours of the end of the previous round unless an offer has been
                accepted before that.</li>
                <li>You may begin scheduling with your opponent as soon as the pairing is known.</li>
                <li>You must ping your opponent on the forum for any post that concerns them. Editing a
                post is not allowed.</li>
                <li>To prevent time zone confusion, you must communicate all times in UTC.</li>
                <li>A player must be able to accept new messages while being included in the pairings.</li>
                <li>The 3 offered times must not all be within 24 hours of each other and at least 3 hours
                apart.</li>
                <li>If someone is found to purposely repeatedly offer unsuitable times to their opponent just
                so that they can claim a forfeit (eg: your 3 offered times are all 2-3 am for your opponent,
                and when your opponent asks you to offer more, you offer the same ones on different
                dates), the TDs may take action on you.</li>
                <li>If 3 offers are not made in time, the player at fault must accept an offer made by their
                opponent.</li>
                <li>If both players make 3 offers and none of the 6 times are suitable for both players, each
                player must offer 3 more times, different from the ones offered before.</li>
                <li>If no agreement is reached before the weekend, the TDs will determine if the fault lies
                with a particular player.</li>
                <li>It is not allowed to agree to a draw without playing the series.</li>
                <li>If the TDs determine the fault of one player, the player must accept an offer given by
                their opponent.</li>
                <li>If no player is at fault, the match will be ruled as a 0-0 draw. Note that this will affect your
                team's tiebreaks, so it is recommended to put forth your best efforts to schedule a
                match.</li>
                <li>Case-by-case exceptions can be made at the TD's discretion.</li></ol></p>

            <h2>6. Reporting Cheats</h2>
            <p><ol><li>Accusations of cheating must be made privately to the TDs. Any accusation in public will
                result in the disqualification of the accuser, regardless of whether the accusation was
                true or not.</li>
                <li>For the above rules, "Public" also includes the non-private channels on discord servers
                whose link is available for anybody to join (eg: Lidiscord, The House Discord, etc)</li></ol></p>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Match Rules (except the format)</h2>
            <p><ol><li>Each player has a right to call a break once during a match. The break can last a
                maximum of 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>If no break is called, the rematch offer must be accepted immediately. Repeated failure
                to do so will result in a forfeit.</li>
                <li>If a player leaves without completing the match, they get 10 minutes to come back, and
                this is counted as their break. If they don't come back in 10 minutes, their opponent gets
                the option to claim the win. If they have already utilised their break before they left, their
                opponent immediately gets the option to claim a win.</li>
                <li>If a player forfeits twice, they are disqualified from the tournament.</li>
                </ol></p>
        </section>
        <section>
           <h2>8. Disqualification and Withdrawals</h2>
            <p><ol><li>If a player is disqualified while having an incomplete pairing, their opponent wins the
                match.</li>
                <li>If a player is banned by lichess, they have the opportunity to prove to the TDs that their
                ban was NOT for cheating. If they can prove it, their completed matches are reopened. If
                they cannot, their completed matches are adjudicated in favour of their opponents.</li>
                <li>If a player gets banned by lichess for games not related to the tournament, they are still
                disqualified, and the above condition applies.</li>
                </ol></p>

        <section>
            <h1>Tournament-Specific Rules</h1>
            <p>These are the rules which are different from the ones used in previous tournaments</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>9. Tournament Format</h2>
            <p><ol><li>There will be teams of 4 players each, who will compete against each other in a
                Swiss-System Tournament. However, if the number of teams participating is less than
                10, each team will be reduced to 3 players each.</li>
                <li>The tournament will only happen if the number of teams participating are 10 or above.
                </li>
                <li>The next stage after the Swiss-system will be a knockout stage between the top teams.
                The number of teams qualifying to the knockout stage are:<br>
                Number of Teams&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Knockout Stage<br>
                10 to 15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  Top 4 Teams<br>
                16 to 31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  Top 8 Teams<br>
                32 to 63&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|  Top 16 Teams<br>
                If more than 63 teams participate, then a Candidates Stage will be held, similar to ACWC
                and LAWC. The rules for the candidates stage will be announced soon after the closure
                of registrations, if it is required.</li>
                <li>If a player withdraws from the tournament, they go through the same process as a player
                getting disqualified from the tournament, and the case is treated as such. However, their
                previous match results are not affected.</li>
                </ol></p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>10. Team Rules</h2>
            <p><ol><li>A player can only be part of one team. You also cannot make a team in which you are on
                multiple boards.</li>
                <li>While registering, players are requested to register their entire team at once. However, if
                players want to register but haven't found teammates yet, they can contact the TDs, and
                the TDs will recommend them teammates.</li>
                <li>Each team should assign one player as the captain (it is recommended to make the
                strongest player the captain).</li>
                <li>Each team should not have more than two AGM or higher in it.</li>
                <li>If a player is eligible for AGM title but hasn't claimed it yet, they are considered an AGM
                or higher for seeding.</li>
                <li>The 6 strongest players currently: Pinni, Preslav, TUGR, Tetiksh, Sude and Valentino will
                all be in different teams if they decide to participate.</li>
                <li> Restrictions for players on board 4:<ol>
                <li>If a team has 2 players who are AGM or above, their Board 4 player should not
                be above 2000 rating.</li>
                <li>If a team has only 1 ASGM and no AGM, their board 4 should not be above 2100
                rating.</li>
                <li>If a team has only 1 AGM and no ASGM, their board 4 should not be above 2150
                rating.</li>
                <li>If a team has no AGM or ASGM, their board 4 should not be above 2200 rating.</li></ol></li>
                <li>The rating restriction counts since 1 January 2025. If the player has crossed the rating
                threshold before 1 January 2025 but not after (they should not be rated above the
                threshold since 1 Jan), they are eligible.
                <ol><li>If a player crosses their rating threshold on three different days or more since 1st
                January 2025, they are considered above that rating. Players crossing the rating
                cap once or twice since 1st January 2025 and then falling back are not
                considered above their threshold.</li>
                <li>If the player crosses the rating threshold and maintains it for more than one day,
                they are considered above the threshold.</li>
                <li>Players crossing the threshold with a high RD (Above 80) are not considered
                above the threshold.</li></ol> </li>
                <li>The team will have to replace the board 4 player if the player crosses the threshold
                before 25th April 2025.</li>
                <li>The 4 boards will be ranked according to the player's strength/rating. This is done by the
                TDs when the team registers.</li>
                <li>After the TDs determine the order of the players on each board, they will also inform the
                captain of the team if the team is allowed to interchange the boards of certain players (if
                the TDs think that those players are similar/comparable in strength/rating). The team is
                allowed to make those changes and submit their final, board-wise list to a TD. The team
                can also choose to keep the same order as given by the TDs.</li>
                <li>Due to the above rule, it is also possible that your captain may end up not on board 1,
                which is perfectly fine.</li>
                <li>Each team is allowed to change their captain ONCE in the tournament. However, this
                change will only take effect from future rounds.</li>
                <li>To prevent discrepancies, no two TDs will be in the same team, and no TD will be the
                team captain.</li>
                <li>A team is allowed to have 5 members. However, only 4 players can play at a time. The
                5th player is allowed to replace players who have a similar rating as the 5th player. For
                this change to take effect, the team captain must inform the TD before the next week’s
                pairings are released as to which player is going to sit out the next round.<ol>
                <li>For the knockout stages, a team can only make changes to the lineup of 4
                players who are going to play, if they finish their match (and win) before it is
                known as to whom they will face in the next round.</li>
                <li>Tip: It is not recommended to have a 5th member if all 4 players of the team are
                apart in rating.</li></ol></li>
                <li>If a player of a team gets disqualified, the team is allowed to name a replacement with
                the following conditions:<ol>
                <li>The replacement must be willing to participate in the tournament.</li>
                <li>The replacement must qualify under the eligibility criteria.</li>
                <li>If, after the disqualification of a previous player, the matches are re-opened, the
                replacement must be willing to play the re-opened matches before the stage
                ends.</li>
                <li>The replacement must be at least 100 rating points lower in strength/rating than
                the player the person is replacing.</li></ol></li>
                <li>If two players from a team get disqualified during the tournament, the entire team gets
                disqualified.</li>
                <li>If the captain of the team gets disqualified, the entire team gets disqualified (the captain
                cannot be replaced). However, if the player who is the current captain wants to be
                replaced, the player has to make another player the captain (provided that the captain
                hasn't been replaced before), and only after one round is played with another player as
                captain can the initial captain withdraw.<ol>
                <li>A team with 5 players is allowed to let their captain sit out of a round (if the 5th
                player has a similar rating/strength as the captain).</li>
                <li>The captain cannot sit out of the knockout stage.</li></ol></li>
                <li>The team is allowed to include players who are chatbanned, but the Captain must be
                willing to mediate for the chatbanned player and help the player schedule their matches.</li>
                <li>A new feature on lichess gives a person a full communication ban, which prevents them
                from even sending DMs to other players. These players cannot be captains. If such a
                person exists on a team, the team Captain should inform the TDs before the start of the
                tournament. During the tournament, the match negotiations of the person will be handled
                by the captain.</li>
                <li>The TDs may call for a team captain to be replaced if the original team captain is not
                following the rules properly. If this is done, the team still has the option to change their
                captain ONCE in the tournament after this, as long as the new captain is not the one
                removed by the TDs.</li>

            <h2>11. Match Rules Related to Format</h2>
             <p><ol><li>This tournament will have matches played over multiple time controls. Each match
                between two players will have 3 parts:<ol>
                <li>4 games of 2+5</li>
                <li>6 games of 1+2</li>
                <li>8 games of 0+2</li></ol></li>
                <li>The parts can be played in any order the players decide. If they are not able to decide on
                a particular order, the order to be followed will be 0+2, 2+5, 1+2.</li>
                <li>The players have 1 minute between the two parts of the match to send a challenge to
                their opponent of the time control of the next part. If the next part does not start within 1
                minute of the end of the previous part, it is counted as the break of the player at fault. If
                the break was already taken by the player at fault before, the opponent may choose to
                claim a forfeit of that part of the match.</li>
                <li>Each part of the match has equal scoring. Hence, 2.5-1.5 in 2+5 gives you more
                points than 4.5-3.5 in 0+2.</li>
                <li>Each part of the match has 48 points up for grabs. The points per win or draw in each
                part are given below. A loss gives 0 points.<br>
                Time Control&nbsp; | Win &nbsp;| Draw<br>
                2+5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;6<br>
                1+2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;4<br>
                0+2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;3</li>
                <li>Each match has 576 points up for grabs. If a team reaches 289, it wins the match.
                However, it still has to play the remaining games (if any).</li>
                <li>For the knockout stages, the match will be of 4 parts, with the extra part having 4 games
                of 5+0, and similar scoring as 2+5. If the players cannot agree upon the order of playing
                the time controls, the order should be 0+2, 2+5, 5+0, 1+2.</li>
                <li>The final (and bronze medal match) will have 5 parts, with the extra part having 8 games
                of 0.5+1, and similar scoring as 0+2. If the players cannot agree upon the order of
                playing the time controls, the order should be 0+2, 2+5, 0.5+1. 5+0, 1+2.</li>
                <li>The result of the match played must be given to your team captain, who will give the
                result of the team to the TDs when all 4 players finish their matches.</li>
                <li>Note that the individual score on each board adds up to make up the team total. Hence,
                it is also possible for your team to lose on 3 boards, win on one and still win the match.</li>
                <li>Since the scoring is complicated, the TDs will contact all the team captains on how to
                report the scores to the TDs before the start of the tournament.</li>
                 </ol></p>

            <h2>12. Tiebreaks in Knockout Matches</h2>
             <p><ol><li>If a knockout match ends in a tie on total score, then the first tiebreak applied is the
                Captains' result.<ol>
                <li>If both team captains are on the same board (have faced each other in the
                match), then the winner of that match gets the "advantage point" for the tiebreak
                match.</li>
                <li>If both team captains were on different boards, no team captain gets the
                "advantage point" for the tiebreak match.</li></ol></li>
                <li>If no player has the "advantage point", then the captains play 4 games of 3+0 against
                each other to decide the winner. If this ends as a 2-2 draw, an armageddon game is
                played.</li>
                <li>In the tiebreak match, the "advantage point" counts as a 1-0 score before the start of the
                match for the player with the advantage point. Therefore, after the 4 games are played,
                the player with the advantage point gets +1 added to his score. If the final score here
                reaches 2.5-2.5, an armageddon game is played.</li>
                 </ol></p>

            <h2>13. General Rules Different from Previous Tournaments</h2>
             <p><ol><li>TDs: The main tournament directors are cFlour and TheUnknownGuyReborn. Other
                tournament directors (if any) will be announced soon.</li>
                <li>Accusation of cheating: You are allowed to discuss the possibility of an opponent
                cheating with the members of your team. However, if you talk about it to somebody
                outside your team (especially to the person you are accusing), and they send
                screenshots of you accusing them/some player to the TDs, you will be disqualified.</li>
                <li>Tiebreaks: The ties for the Swiss Stage will be broken by:<ol>
                <li>Points Difference (Points Scored - Points scored by your opponents against you)</li>
                <li>Points Scored (If your team has had 0-0 draws between players, this will rank
                you lower as compared to other teams)</li>
                <li>Median-Buchholz Method</li></ol></li>
                <li>Situations involving a TD: If a certain situation which requires a TD to get involved has
                another TD as one of the players, the "player TD" will not take part in the decision
                process.</li>
                <li>Inbox Flooding: If a player is found to be bombarding their opponent with excessive
                messages unrelated to the scheduling of matches, their opponent may contact a TD and
                ask to cut off direct contact. Henceforth, the player sending excessive messages to their
                opponents may only schedule matches through mediation by their team captain.<ol>
                <li>If the captain does "Inbox Flooding" for no reason, the TDs reserve the right to
                replace the captain.</li></ol></li>
                <li>Duration: The tournament will last 9 weeks if the number of teams is 10-15. It will last 11
                weeks if the number of teams is 15-31. Accordingly, two weeks more if more teams
                register.</li>
                <li>In case of any scenario not listed in the rules, the TDs reserve the right to decide at their
                discretion.</li>
